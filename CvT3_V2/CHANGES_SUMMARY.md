# HTR Model Changes: From Chunking to 64x512 Resizing

## Summary of Changes

The HTR model has been updated to use simple image resizing to 64x512 instead of the previous chunking approach. This simplifies the architecture and processing pipeline significantly.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Updated Configuration
- **File**: `HTR_3Stage.py`
- **Change**: Modified `DEFAULT_CVT_3STAGE_CONFIG` to use stride `(2,2)` for all stages
- **Reason**: Progressive downsampling: 64x512 → 32x256 → 16x128 → 8x64

### 2. Replaced ImageChunker with ImageResizer
- **Removed**: `ImageChunker` class with complex chunking logic
- **Added**: `ImageResizer` class with simple resizing to 64x512
- **Benefits**: 
  - Much simpler preprocessing
  - No overlap handling needed
  - Consistent input dimensions
  - Faster processing

### 3. Updated CvT3Stage Architecture
- **Input size**: Changed from variable width chunks (320px) to fixed 64x512
- **Forward pass**: Updated comments and dimension tracking
- **Stages**: 
  - Stage 1: 64x512 → 32x256 (stride 2x2)
  - Stage 2: 32x256 → 16x128 (stride 2x2) 
  - Stage 3: 16x128 → 8x64 (stride 2x2)

### 4. Simplified HTRModel
- **Constructor**: Now takes `target_height=64, target_width=512` instead of chunking parameters
- **Forward method**: Completely rewritten to handle single 64x512 images
- **Features**: Direct feature extraction without chunk merging
- **Output**: Time sequence of length 64 (width dimension after 3 stages)

### 5. New Features Added
- **Automatic resizing**: Handles images of any size by resizing to 64x512
- **Batch processing**: Processes entire batches efficiently
- **Decode predictions**: Added method to decode CTC predictions to text
- **Input validation**: Handles different input formats (tensors, lists, etc.)

## Usage Changes

### Before (Chunking):
```python
model = HTRModel(vocab_size, target_height=40, chunk_width=320, 
                first_stride=200, stride=240)
```

### After (Resizing):
```python
model = HTRModel(vocab_size, target_height=64, target_width=512)
```

## Processing Pipeline

### Before:
1. Resize image to height 40px (preserve aspect ratio)
2. Create overlapping chunks of 320px width
3. Process each chunk through CvT
4. Merge chunk features with overlap handling
5. Apply classifier

### After:
1. Resize any image to exactly 64x512 
2. Process through CvT backbone once
3. Convert 2D features to 1D time sequence (average over height)
4. Apply classifier

## Benefits of the New Approach

1. **Simplicity**: Much simpler code and logic
2. **Speed**: No chunking overhead, single forward pass
3. **Memory**: More predictable memory usage
4. **Consistency**: All images processed at same resolution
5. **Debugging**: Easier to debug and understand

## Potential Considerations

1. **Aspect Ratio**: Images are now stretched/squeezed to fit 64x512
2. **Resolution**: Some very high-resolution images may lose detail when downscaled
3. **Text Length**: Limited to sequences that fit in the 64 time steps (after 3 stages of 2x downsampling)

## Testing

A test script `test_resized_model.py` has been created to validate the changes:
- Tests image resizing functionality
- Tests model forward pass
- Tests CTC loss computation
- Tests prediction decoding

## Files Modified

1. `model/HTR_3Stage.py`: Main model file with all changes
2. `test_resized_model.py`: New test script

The model is now ready to use with the simplified 64x512 resizing approach!
